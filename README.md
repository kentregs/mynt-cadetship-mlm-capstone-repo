# Machine Learning Implementation & Operations Capstone Project
These notebooks demonstrate how to generate synthetic regression data and train and cross validate sklearn regression models (i.e. LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor) along with Amazon SageMaker's built-in XGBoost algorithm. The final notebook ([4] final_capstone_ntbk.ipynb) contains all of the insights and model evaluation data that were produced.

The predict endpoint is deployed through a Flask application. Simply run the following command to deploy it:
```
python app.py
```
